<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About</h3>

<p> Welcome! This website describes the activities of the research group led by Dr. Christopher D. Cooper, based in the <a href="http://mecanica.usm.cl/" style="color:#52adc8;">Departament of Mechanical Engineering</a> of <a href="http://usm.cl/" style="color:#52adc8;">Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María</a> (USM), in Valparaíso, Chile. Our research interest is in the development of fast and accurate computational models for molecular electrostatics and solvation, mainly using implicit solvent models and boundary integral methods.</p>

[2021/12/09] Solid presentation from Ignacio Muñoz for his undergraduate thesis work got maximum score. Beautiful work on free energy calculations of nonpolar solvation, co-advised with José Antonio Gárate (Universidad de Valparaíso). Congratulations! 
[2021/12/01] Mauricio Guerrero was accepted in the doctoral program to continue working with us towards a PhD. Way to go, Mauricio! <br>
[2021/10/15] Christopher recieves an Excellence in Teaching award (Maestro Destacado).  <br>
[2021/10/08] Sergio Urzúa and Mauricio Guerrero presented their work in the <a href="https://jmc-2021.web.app/" style="color:#52adc8;"> XIX Jornada de Mecánica Computacional</a>, hosted by USM. Great job Sergio and Mauricio! <br>
