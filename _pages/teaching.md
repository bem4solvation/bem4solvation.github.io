Teaching courses on fluid mechanics, CFD and fast algorithms.

### Advanced fluid mechanics
Fourth year undergraduate course for mechanical engineering majors on selected topics in fluid mechanics. We cover potential flow, aerodynamics, boundary layer theory, turbulence, and compressible flow --- in an introductory level. Class notes can be found in my [Github account](https://github.com/cdcooper84/mec220).

### Fundamentals of computational fluid dynamics
Fourth year undergraduate course for mechanical engineering majors, introducing them to computational fluid dynamics. Class notes and lab sessions can be found in a the following [link](https://github.com/usantamaria/mec223_laboratorios).

### Fast algorithms
Graduate level course for mechanical engineering and computer science students. In this course, we discuss different algorithms to accelerate linear solvers and N-body problems. In particular, we cover Multigrid, FFT-based methos, Treecodes, Fast Multipole Methods, Fast Ewald Summations, and Hierarchical Matrices. Some demos I developed for this course are available in my [Github account](https://github.com/cdcooper84/fast_algorithms), and the class projects can be found in this [link](https://github.com/usantamaria/IPM-407_Fast_algorithms).
