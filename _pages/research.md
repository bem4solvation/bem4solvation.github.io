## Implicit solvent models

My main research line is in the development of computer codes to simulate protein solvation with continuum electrostatic models (ie. considering the solvent as a dielectric region).
This yields system of PDEs where the Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equations are coupled on the molecular surface. 
I solve with boundary element methods, accelerated with fast methods that run on GPUs.

I have mostly worked on a code called [PyGBe](https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe), which we have used to study solvation, binding, adsorption, among other things.
